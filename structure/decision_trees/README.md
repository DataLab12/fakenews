### Directions for running decision tree scripts

These scripts implement decision trees on the feature vector dataset using multi-class labels, coarse (i) labels, and 
coarse (ii) labels.

The packages sklearn, pandas, csv, seaborn, datetime, and openpyxl are required to run these scripts.

Input is the feature vector CSVs, output is a CSV of labels for the test data.  

Python (3.7.3) and Jupyter Notebook (5.7.8) are required.
