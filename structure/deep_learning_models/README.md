### Deep learning models

These models apply the conspiracy data to examples given by *[StellarGraph](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)*

The code was adapted from demos *[here](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demos/graph-classification/dgcnn-graph-classification.html)* and *[here](https://stellargraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/demos/graph-classification/gcn-supervised-graph-classification.html)*.
